# Introduction-to-Computer-Science
Projects from Fall 2023 for Introduction to Computer Science (CSC11) course in Java

# Course Overview
This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of computer programming and algorithmic
problem solving. In this course, students will learn about concepts in computer science (e.g.,
abstraction, decomposition, etc.) through the explicit tasks of learning Java and building software
artifacts.
Students enrolled in this course are NOT expected to have any prior programming experience.
In addition to satisfying a divisional requirement, CSC 111 also gives elective credit for those
interested in an entrepreneurship minor at Wake Forest. Finally, it is recommended as the first
course for students considering a major or minor in computer science.

# Learning Outcomes
After successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
• Analyze and explain the behavior of programs involving fundamental program constructs,
such as variables, conditional statements, loops, arrays, methods, and objects
• Write well-documented programs that use fundamental program constructs to solve basic
problems involving linear data structures such as searching and sorting
• Identify and correct syntax and logical errors in programs using effective debugging and
testing methods
• Design and implement classes based on the attributes and behaviors needed to solve specific
problems.
• Design and implement object-oriented code employing class relationships such as inheritance,
composition, aggregation, and association
