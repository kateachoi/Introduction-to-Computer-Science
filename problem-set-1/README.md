# CSC 111: Problem Set #1
Learning Objectives:
1) Write, compile, and execute a basic Java program in IntelliJ
2) Write Java statements to produce output to the screen
3) Write Java statements to accept user input from the keyboard
4) Use variables and operators to manipulate primitive data types
5) Solve a complex problem computationally by breaking it down into smaller and simpler sequential steps

## 1. Rocket Pattern
Write a Java program called Rocket that generates a pattern of symbols showing a rocket. Use static methods to show structure and eliminate as much redundancy as possible in your solution.

## 2. Alexis
Write a Java program called Alexis for this problem. Use a Scanner object to get user input. In particular, use nextLine() to read everything the user types, including spaces, until the return key is pressed. Scanner doesnâ€™t work very well when different methods to read input are used in the same program. Also, go ahead and use variables of String type for all inputs.

## 3. Web Page Generator
Write a Java program called HomePageGenerator capable of generating very simple home pages.

## 4. Carbon Footprint
Write a Java program called CarbonFootprintCalculator that helps users estimate the carbon footprint of foods they might eat in a daily basis. Your CarbonFootprintCalculator program should ask the user to enter their estimated daily consumption in kCal for only the following items: beef, chicken, cheese, yogurt, milk, eggs, rice, tofu, beans, lentils, and nuts. It then should calculate the daily and annual amount of CO2e for their food choices.

## 5. Loan Calculator
Implement a Java program called LoanCalculator that computes the monthly payment required to pay off the loan as well as the total interest that needs to be paid over the course of the loan.

BONUS: A smarter LoanCalculator helps you save money by informing you of the amount of money you would save if you shorten the term of the loan, or if you go to a different bank and negotiate a better interest rate. Your task is to compute the new monthly payment and the amount of interest saved if the user were to (1) shorten the term of the loan by X years or (2) reduce the interest rate by Y%, while keeping other factors constant.
