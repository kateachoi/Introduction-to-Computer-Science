# CSC 111: Problem Set #4
Learning Objectives:
1) Examine and explain how existing code is designed using UML diagrams
2) Create classes and objects for implementing basic Java applications

## Technical Requirements
1) Your code must include the definition and usage of at least two new Java classes. These classes can
be stand-alone or can be subclasses of an existing Java class. Implementing an interface also counts as
definition of a new Java class.
2) Your code must be well documented, beyond adding the required comment block at the top of each
file.
3) The project should include a text-based Readme file briefly explaining the purpose and functionality of
your Java application. Also, list design decisions made during implementation of the code.
